Kaden's Personal Website.

Dude why are you reading this?

This is my first official publicly available website. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it yet, but I'm sure I'll figure something out.
It'll likely be a place to host my projects, and maybe some other stuff. Keep an eye out for updates!
